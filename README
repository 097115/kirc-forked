kirc

KISS for IRC, an IRC client written in POSIX C99.


BACKGROUND
----------

After having tried multiple IRC clients, I decided to develope my own. The 
result is a portable <250 sloc application that has no dependencies other 
than a C99 compiler.


TODO
----

- [ ] capture CTRL-C for safer child process shutdown
- [ ] better color default color scheme
- [ ] dynamic word wrap based on column width
- [ ] additional shortcut keys
- [ ] fix default arrow key and backspace behavior


FEATURES
--------

- automatic host PING response.
- vi-like shortcuts:

  :m <message> send a message to the connected channel
  :q           close the host connection and quit kirc


INSTALLATION
------------

Building and installing from source:

    git clone https://github.com/mcpcpc/kirc.git
	cd kirc
	make
	make install
