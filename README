kirc

KISS for IRC, an IRC client written in POSIX C99.


BACKGROUND
----------

After having tried multiple IRC clients, I decided to develope my own. The 
result is a portable <250 sloc application that has no dependencies other 
than a C99 compiler.


FEATURES
--------

- automatic host PING response.
- vi-like shortcuts:

  :m <message> send a message to the connected channel
  :q           close the host connection and quit kirc


INSTALLATION
------------

Building and installing from source:

    git clone https://github.com/mcpcpc/kirc.git
	cd kirc
	make
	make install


USAGE
-----

usage: kirc [-s hostname] [-p port] [-c channel] [-n nick] [-v|V]
-s     server address (default: 'irc.freenode.org')
-p     server port (default: '6667')
-c     channel name (default: '#kisslinux')
